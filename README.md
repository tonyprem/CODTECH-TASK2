Overview of the Project

Project:TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MONITORING WITH DHT SENSOR

Objective

Design and implement a temperature and humidity monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller and a DHT sensor. This project aims to provide real-time environmental data by reading temperature and humidity levels and displaying the information on a serial monitor or an external display. The project also aims to introduce data logging and basic sensor interfacing techniques.

Key Activities

Understand Sensor Interfacing: Learn how to interface the DHT sensor with an Arduino to read temperature and humidity data . *Learn Arduino Programming: Write a program (sketch) using the Arduino IDE to capture and process data from the DHT sensor.

Display Real-Time Data: Display the temperature and humidity readings on the serial monitor or an LCD/OLED screen.

Data Logging (Optional): Learn to store the readings on an SD card or transmit them wirelessly to another device for logging and analysis.

Implement Threshold Alerts (Optional): Set up alerts (e.g., LED indicators, buzzer alarms) when certain temperature or humidity thresholds are crossed.

Expand Knowledge: Provide a foundation for more complex projects, such as home automation or weather stations, involving multiple sensors and actuators.
